*Comment on these plots:*
- *CPI*: Non stationary looks like a deterministic trend (unit root) --> hence detrending can render our series stationary and we will test First Differences for stationarity, if this fails we will try higher order integrations to get a stationary series
- *IPI*: Looks non-stationary, determinisic trend (unit root) and additionally it seems like there is a structural break in our data at the financial crisis (2008 - 2009) [**Magnitude: sharp and much larger drop than usual, Persistence: no return to pre-crisis levels, Post-Break: Possibly new level and Trend**]
--> again here we will test for Integration of order 1 I(1) for stationarity
- *Credit Spread:* Look stationary only GFC break needs to be accounted for (othwise could fail stationarity tests) --> no differencin needed 


## Exercise 1.2: Conduct unit root and stationarity tests for each series

Given our previous results we propose to test the following unit root specifications: 

1) We will log CPI and IPI for two reasons, first trends here have a multiplicative relationship and not a linear one hence logarithm allows us to create a linear relationship which is necessary to apply AR, ARMA etc. (Linear Time Series Analysis to them)

2) Given that we already know we will apply at least 1 unit differences to get stationary results I(1) processes from our previous visual inspection of the data this gives us a nice feature for interpretation (e.g. we can interprete our log differences as growth rates *GIVE REASON HERE BRIEFLY*)

```{r exercise_1/2, include=FALSE}

## Exercise 1.2 Unit Root and Stationarity tests 

# 1. Take Logs and deltas of time series ----

industrial <- industrial %>% 
  mutate(log_value = log(value))  %>% 
  mutate(dlog_value = log_value - lag(log_value)) %>%
  drop_na(dlog_value) # Drop first observation because of NA (othwerwise VARselect won't work)



cpi <- cpi %>% 
  mutate(log_value = log(value))  %>% 
  mutate(dlog_value = log_value - lag(log_value)) %>%
  drop_na(dlog_value) # Drop first observation because of NA (othwerwise VARselect won't work)

# Take FD for credit spreads --> No Log Transformation here 
credit_spread <- credit_spread %>%
  mutate(cs_d1= credit_spread$value - lag(credit_spread$value)) %>%
  drop_na(cs_d1)

# 1.2 Briefly look at plots of the Transformed Data 

plot(industrial$dlog_value) # no visible trend, fluctuates around constant mean close to 0 --> DRIFT 
plot(cpi$dlog_value) # more more volatile, no visible trend, fluctuates around constant around mean a bit > 0  --> DRIFT
plot(credit_spread$value) # fluctuation around constant mean 4-6 bps with a few dramatic spikes in crises 
plot(credit_spread$cs_d1) # look stationary around 0, with crisis outliers 

# 2. Unit Root tests ----

# 2.1 Use the VARS function to check the optimal # of lags ---- 
## Reminder: We are using monthly data so reasonable maximum lag order for monthly data is 12 months
# Use AIC for lag selection in ADF tests (Ng & Perron 2001 Lag Length Selection and the Construction of Unit Root Tests with Good Size and Power) 
# AIC better size and power for unit root tests 

VARselect(industrial$log_value, lag.max=12) #Result: AIC: 8 --> choose 7
VARselect(cpi$log_value, lag.max=12) #AIC 12 
VARselect(industrial$dlog_value, lag.max=12) #Result: AIC: 7 --> choose 7
VARselect(cpi$dlog_value, lag.max=12) #Result: consensus 12 lags 
VARselect(credit_spread$value, lag.max=12) # Result: AIC: 7  --> choose 7 Lags 
VARselect(credit_spread$cs_d1, lag.max = 12) # AIC: 6


## 2.1. Unit Root tests without Differentiation ---- 

### URCA - for unit root tests (w/o trends in the beginning only add trend if phi3: H0(trend=0)  â> reject)
### Remember use an appropriate maximum number of lags --> 12 for monthly data 
### We selected AIC lags anyway so we can let the function do this automatically and just give max # lags (12 for monthly)

#### c) FD levels difference Credit Spread 

adf_cs_diff <- ur.df(credit_spread$cs_d1,

```

*Result*: **Include 2 Tables here showing all the results of the manny tets in a nice overview, to many tests to create an extra table for all the tests**

- Alle 3 Units fail stationarity in the first test which comes a bit suprising for credit spread because we originally would have thaugt that the Credit spread at least would be stationary without transformation --> here we couldn't clearly conclude stationary or non-stationarity, the safe choce is always to go with non-stationarity (because stationarity are simplifying properties we can not just assume --> easier to transform to stationary series)
- First Differences passed all stationarity tests --> All 3 series are integrated of order 1 
--> Can now continue to Model the ARMA process for these I(1) series
